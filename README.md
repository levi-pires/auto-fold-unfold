# Auto Fold & Unfold for VS Code v0.8.2

This extension is under construction. Auto F&U automatically folds and unfolds when the cursor enters or leaves the function.

## How to install

```bash
code --install-extension levipires.auto-fold-unfold
```

or download it from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=levipires.auto-fold-unfold#overview).

## How to use

It's simple! You just need to place the cursor inside a function for it to open. And guess what happens if you leave the function!? Exactly!
It magically closes and puts miles of code under one line. It's a piece of cake.

And now, if you are using version 0.4.0 or higher, you can use this same magic when saving, when opening a file and when changing between files. It's all an option.
